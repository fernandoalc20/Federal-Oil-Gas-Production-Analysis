# Federal-Oil-Gas-Production-Analysis

U.S. Federal Oil & Gas Production Analysis (2015–2025)

This project analyzes over a decade of U.S. federal and Native American oil and natural gas production data (2015–2025), compiled from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The goal is to identify revenue trends, production dynamics, and key economic drivers shaping U.S. energy output and market performance.

Final Results & Insights

Revenue Trends (2015–2025):

2020: $66B — pandemic low

2021–2024: steady recovery (+4–8% YoY)

2024: $86B — highest on record

2025 (Jan–May): $35B - trending 1.8% below 2024 pace

CAGR (2015–2024): +4.9%, strong long-term growth

Insight: Growth rebounded strongly post-COVID but is now slowing; 2025 is underperforming early-year expectations. The 4.9% CAGR exceeds the GDP growth rate of 2.8% in 2024, signaling that the oil and gas sector has expanded at a faster and more robust pace than the overall economy, driven by commodity demand and price recovery.

Oil vs Gas Composition:

Oil: $563B (78% of total revenue) from ~41K transactions

Gas: $160B (22% of total revenue) from ~120K transactions

Insight: Oil dominates federal revenue despite far fewer transactions, showing that each barrel of oil generates much more income than each unit of gas.

Onshore vs Offshore:

Offshore: $362B (50% of total) — 92% oil, 8% gas

Onshore: $360B (50% of total) — 64% oil, 36% gas

Insight: Offshore drilling dominates oil production, while onshore operations provide diversification and stability.

Top Producing Regions:

Offshore (Oil): $373B

New Mexico: $175B (Oil + Gas)

Wyoming: $64B (mostly gas)

North Dakota: $23B (mostly oil)

Insight: Three regions (Offshore, NM, WY) account for ~36% of total U.S. energy revenue — a sign of high geographic concentration risk.

Business Impact:

The U.S. energy sector shows strong long-term growth outpacing national GDP.

Heavy oil dependency (78%) increases vulnerability to price volatility and regulatory shifts.


Diversifying production and strengthening gas infrastructure could improve resilience and long-term sustainability.

Additional analyses in BigQuery confirmed minimal seasonal variation across quarters, so quarterly trends were not visualized.
